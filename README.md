# Web Project (Timezone Dashboard)

The objective of this project is to explore RESTful API design and principles in both vanilla PHP and laravel. Focused on **secure RESTful API development with PHP** and **MySQL database design**.

## Overview

So far I have:

- **Implemented RESTful API endpoints**: Stateless endpoints for registration and login.
- **Implemented JWT authentication**: Stateless token-based authentication.
- **Data sanitization/validation**: Enforced character restrictions and input length.
- **Implemented HTTP response codes**: 201, 400, 401, 500 used appropriately.
- **Improved version control skills**: Managed project with Git/GitHub.
- **Environment configuration**: Managed secrets using `.env` file.
- **Error handling and structured responses**: Standardized JSON responses.
- **Consistent OO PHP practices**: Modular and maintainable code.
